Group: Requirements

UPS requires the latest ULib to be installed on the server. You can get ULib from <http://ulyssesmod.net>.

Group: Installation

To install UPS, simply extract the files from the archive to your garrysmod/addons folder.
When you've done this, you should have a file structure like this--
<garrysmod root>/addons/UPS/info.txt
<garrysmod root>/addons/UPS/lua/autorun/client/ups_preinit.lua
etc..

Note that installation for dedicated servers is EXACTLY the same!

You absolutely, positively have to do a full server restart after installing the files. A simple map
change will not cut it!

Group: Usage

After you've restarted your server, if you are an admin, the UPS control panel will appear under utilities in the spawn menu. You should also see owner info on props when you're looking at props with the physgun or toolgun equipped.
